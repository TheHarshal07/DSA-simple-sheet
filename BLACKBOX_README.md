The following code is an implementation of the Armstrong number in Python.

An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3.

The code first asks the user to enter a number. It then stores the number in the variable `user`. It then initializes the variable `result` to 0. It also initializes the variable `p` to the value of `user`.

The code then enters a loop. The loop continues as long as `user` is greater than 0. In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the remainder of `user` divided by 10. It then stores this remainder in the variable `rem`. The code then adds `rem` cubed to the variable `result`. Finally, the code divides `user` by 10.

The code then checks if `p` is equal to `result`. If it is, the code prints a message saying that `p` is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, the code prints a message saying that `p` is not an Armstrong number.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The code first asks the user to enter a number.
2. It then stores the number in the variable `user`.
3. It then initializes the variable `result` to 0.
4. It also initializes the variable `p` to the value of `user`.
5. The code then enters a loop. The loop continues as long as `user` is greater than 0.
6. In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the remainder of `user` divided by 10.
7. It then stores this remainder in the variable `rem`.
8. The code then adds `rem` cubed to the variable `result`.
9. Finally, the code divides `user` by 10.
10. The code then checks if `p` is equal to `result`.
11. If it is, the code prints a message saying that `p` is an Armstrong number.
12. Otherwise, the code prints a message saying that `p` is not an Armstrong number.
